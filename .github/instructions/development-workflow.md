## Development Philosophy
- **Human-Led**: You provide strategic direction, requirements, and triggers
- **AI-Assisted**: AI implements features following established patterns and guidelines
- **Iterative**: Small, testable increments with continuous feedback
- **Quality-First**: Every change must pass tests and maintain architectural integrity

## AI Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning & Analysis
1. **Requirement Analysis**: AI reviews existing docs and asks clarifying questions
2. **Architecture Planning**: AI proposes implementation approach
3. **Task Breakdown**: AI creates detailed implementation plan
4. **Risk Assessment**: AI identifies potential issues and dependencies

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Scaffold Creation**: AI creates basic file structure
2. **Core Implementation**: AI implements functionality following patterns
3. **Test Creation**: AI writes comprehensive tests
4. **Documentation**: AI updates relevant documentation

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Code Review**: AI self-reviews against established patterns
2. **Test Execution**: AI ensures all tests pass
3. **Integration Check**: AI verifies integration with existing features
4. **Documentation Review**: AI ensures docs are up-to-date

### Phase 4: Delivery
1. **Pull Request Creation**: AI creates PR with proper description
2. **CI/CD Validation**: Automated checks must pass
3. **Human Review**: You review and approve changes
4. **Issue Management**: AI updates related GitHub issues

## Communication Protocols

### Status Updates
AI should provide regular status updates in this format:
```
## Progress Update

**Feature**: <Feature Name>
**Status**: <In Progress|Blocked|Ready for Review>
**Completion**: <percentage>%

### Completed
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### In Progress
- [ ] Task 3 (50% complete)

### Blocked
- [ ] Task 4 (waiting for clarification on X)

### Next Steps
- Implement task 3
- Await feedback on task 4
```

### Questions & Clarifications
When AI needs clarification, use this format:
```
## Clarification Needed

**Context**: <Brief context of what's being worked on>

**Question**: <Specific question>

**Options Considered**:
1. Option A: <description> (pros/cons)
2. Option B: <description> (pros/cons)

**Recommendation**: <AI's preferred option with reasoning>

**Impact**: <What happens if we delay this decision>
```
