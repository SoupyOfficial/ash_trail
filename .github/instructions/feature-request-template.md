## For AI Implementation

When implementing this feature:

1. **Start with Analysis**: Review existing codebase for similar patterns
2. **Ask Questions**: If any requirements are unclear, ask for clarification
3. **Plan Architecture**: Propose the technical approach before coding
4. **Implement Incrementally**: Build in small, testable pieces
5. **Update Documentation**: Keep all docs current throughout development
6. **Sync Issues**: Update GitHub issues as work progresses

Use the hashtag `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent` when ready to begin implementation.
