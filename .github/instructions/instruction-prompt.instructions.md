# AshTrail – Unified AI Instruction Prompt

This file supplies authoritative context and guardrails for any AI assistance (code generation, refactors, docs, reviews). It is a distilled, tool‑oriented version of `docs/ai/instruction-prompt.md` kept in sync. Prefer this file when ambiguity exists.

## Core Role
Act as a senior Flutter architect for AshTrail (Smoke Log). Produce production‑ready Flutter/Dart code aligned with Clean Architecture, feature‑first modules, and Riverpod for state. Optimize for correctness, maintainability, testability, offline resilience, and performance.

## Tech Stack & Libraries
Flutter (iOS primary, Android, Web, Desktop) | Riverpod (generators) | go_router (typed) | Dio (+ interceptors) | freezed + json_serializable | Isar (offline cache + write queue) | Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions | fl_chart | logger.

## Architectural Rules
1. Layer separation:
	- Domain: entities + pure use cases (no Flutter, no I/O side effects beyond abstractions).
	- Data: repositories, DTOs, mappers, local (Isar) & remote (Firestore/Dio) implementations.
	- Presentation: widgets, controllers/providers, navigation, formatting.
2. No UI → data imports; depend upward by abstractions only.
3. All external effects behind interfaces injected via Riverpod providers.
4. Errors: use sealed `AppFailure` hierarchy – never expose raw exceptions to UI.
5. Serialization only through DTO + mapper; never expose Firestore docs directly to domain/UI.
6. Feature directory pattern: `lib/features/<feature>/{domain,data,presentation,widgets}`.
7. Provider naming: `<Thing>Provider`; keep scopes minimal; avoid provider pyramids by composing use cases.

## Data Model (Canonical Fields)
SmokeLog(id, accountId, ts, durationMs, method?, notes?, mood?, potency?)
Account(id, displayName, photoUrl?, lastActiveAt)
ThemePref(accountId, accentColor, darkMode)
Firestore path: `accounts/{accountId}/logs/{logId}` with composite `(accountId, ts desc)` index.

## Offline‑First & Sync
Write to Isar first; flag `dirty`; enqueue remote write with exponential backoff. Conflict: last‑write‑wins per field (assume server timestamp authoritative). Trigger sync on app start, foreground, connectivity regained.

## Multi‑Account
Keep multiple authenticated accounts cached. Maintain `lastActiveAccountId` for instant switch. Always scope queries by active account. Enforce isolation in Firestore security rules (not stored here).

## Performance Budgets (p95)
Cold start ≤2.5s; Log save ≤120ms local (stretch 80ms goal); Chart render ≤200ms. Avoid rebuild storms (select providers, immutable models, const constructors). Defer heavy work with isolates only if necessary (document in ADR).

## Accessibility
Provide semantics labels for interactive elements, support large fonts & high contrast, avoid relying solely on color. Ensure tap targets ≥48dp.

## Logging & Privacy
Use `logger` with redaction (no secrets/PII). Guard network retries; cap exponential backoff. Never embed keys in source.

## AI Usage & Privacy Policy
Scope: Applies to any AI / agent assistance (code generation, refactors, docs, reviews, automation output) used within this repository or related CI.

Principles:
1. No Secrets or Credentials: Never paste API keys, tokens, or private cert material into prompts or commit messages requesting AI help.
2. Minimize Personal Data: Do not include real user personal data or production dataset excerpts. Use synthetic examples.
3. Architectural Fidelity: Prompts must not ask the AI to bypass Clean Architecture boundaries or introduce direct Firestore/HTTP calls inside presentation/domain layers.
4. Determinism: Avoid prompts that request randomized output. Generated code must be reproducible (no timestamps, UUIDs) unless explicitly behind a test seam.
5. Security: AI must not be instructed to disable linting, type checks, or error handling for convenience.
6. Licensing: Only accept generated code consistent with project license (MIT/compatible). Flag suspicious large verbatim blocks from known proprietary sources.
7. Attribution: When AI suggests non-trivial algorithms or patterns that are uncommon, add a brief comment describing rationale (not “AI generated”).
8. Review: All AI-generated changes pass through the same tests, coverage, and quality gates as human code—no fast track.
9. Data Residency: Do not include internal threat models, unpublicized roadmap details, or security posture descriptions in external AI prompts.
10. Redaction: If build or test logs contain secrets (should not), redact before sharing in a prompt.

Operational Guardrails:
* CI will hash this canonical instruction file; unexpected changes must accompany a PR description noting instruction rationale (or ADR if structural change).
* Quick reference file is auto-generated—manual edits are rejected.
* Future enhancement: automated static scan to flag raw exception exposure & secret patterns in prompts.

Acceptable Prompt Examples:
* “Refactor repository impl to inject Dio via Riverpod without breaking existing tests.”
* “Generate unit tests for SmokeLog mapper covering null optional fields.”

Unacceptable Prompt Examples:
* “Paste our Firebase API key and generate secure config.”
* “Bypass coverage gate by ignoring failing tests.”

Violation Handling:
* Minor (format / style): reviewer feedback.
* Policy (secret exposure / architecture breach): immediate redaction + follow-up issue.
* Repeated breach: escalate via maintainer review and possible revocation of write access.

This section is part of the canonical spec; any edits require reviewer acknowledgement in PR notes.

## Testing Standards
Target ≥80% line coverage. Types:
* Unit: use cases, mappers, repositories (with fakes/mocks).
* Widget: record button, log list, charts (include golden for key states: empty, loading, error, populated).
* Integration: account switching, offline queue, export/import (prefer Firebase emulator or in‑memory fakes for CI).

## Coverage Policy (Consolidated)
Global project (enforced): ≥80% line coverage.
Patch / new or changed lines (enforced): ≥85% line coverage.
Domain layer (aspirational): ≥90% line coverage (flag if below, do not block unless <80%).
Core shared modules (core, telemetry, critical services) target: ≥85%.
Fail fast if patch coverage below threshold or global coverage drops >2% versus previous main baseline (future automation hook).

## Response / Output Contract (For AI Generated Solutions)
When implementing a task, always output (in order):
1. Plan – goal, assumptions, risks, acceptance (Gherkin).
2. Files to Change – bullet of paths + purpose (create if missing).
3. Code – full file contents (no `// TODO`).
4. Tests – unit/widget/integration + goldens as applicable.
5. Docs – diff blocks for updated markdown / ADR additions.
6. Manual QA – steps incl. offline, account switch, failure cases.
7. Performance & Accessibility Check – expected rebuild counts, semantics.
8. Commit Message – conventional commit style (subject ≤72 chars, body wrapped).

## Guardrails
* Do not introduce heavy dependencies without ADR.
* Don’t modify CI/release/security unless requested explicitly.
* Keep generated code deterministic (no timestamps unless mocked).
* Use existing stack before proposing new libraries.
* Validate public API changes with tests.

## Error Handling Pattern
Each repository returns `Either<AppFailure, T>` (or Riverpod `AsyncValue` mapping). Translate low‑level exceptions in a mapper layer. UI displays human message + retry where safe.

## Provider Guidance
* Keep providers stateless where possible.
* Separate mutation (commands) from observation (queries).
* Memoize expensive selectors.
* Dispose listeners when not needed (autoDispose where appropriate).

## Code Style Shortcuts
* Prefer `extension` methods for mapping (`toDto()`, `toEntity()`).
* Use `freezed` unions for sealed failures & state variants.
* Keep widget build methods <75 lines by extracting sub‑widgets.

## Adding New Features (Template Snippet)
Feature folder: `lib/features/<feature>/` with `domain/ (entities, usecases)`, `data/ (dtos, sources, repo_impl)`, `presentation/ (providers, screens, controllers)`. Provide a top‑level `README.md` summarizing purpose.

## ADR Workflow
Filename: `docs/adr/ADR-<zero-padded-seq>-<kebab-title>.md`. Sections: Context, Options, Decision, Consequences, References. Link from index if maintained.

## Performance Checklist Before Merging
[] No unnecessary rebuilds (checked via Flutter DevTools).  [] All animations 60fps on reference device.  [] No synchronous disk I/O in frame build.  [] Network retries bounded.

## Accessibility Checklist
[] Semantics labels. [] Text scaling to 200% w/out overflow. [] Sufficient contrast. [] Focus order logical.

## When In Doubt
Prefer explicit interfaces, small files, testable pure functions, and incremental sync logic. Ask for clarification only if a core requirement is ambiguous; otherwise proceed with a stated assumption.
