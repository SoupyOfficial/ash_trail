## Template Mapping Strategy

### Core Philosophy
Transform ash_trail's Flutter-specific automation into a **declarative, config-driven system** that detects project language and applies appropriate tooling automatically.

### Key Abstractions

1. **Language Detection**: `automation.config.yaml` defines file patterns to detect project type
2. **Command Mapping**: Each core operation (lint, test, build) mapped per language  
3. **Cross-Platform**: Every script has both `.sh` and `.ps1` implementations
4. **Modular Design**: Separate scripts for doctor, lint, test, build, release
5. **CI Templates**: Matrix builds that detect language and run appropriate steps

### Language Support Matrix

| Language | Detect Files | Lint Command | Test Command | Build Command |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | `ruff check .` | `pytest -q` | `python -m build` |
| Java | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | `mvn spotless:apply verify` | `mvn test` | `mvn package` |
| Node | `package.json` | `npm run lint` | `npm test` | `npm run build` |
| Go | `go.mod` | `go vet ./...` | `go test ./...` | `go build ./...` |
| Flutter | `pubspec.yaml` | `flutter analyze` | `flutter test` | `flutter build` |

## Risk Analysis

**Low Risk:**
- Script structure and patterns well-established
- Cross-platform compatibility already proven
- Configuration-driven approach reduces coupling

**Medium Risk:**
- Complex coverage analysis may need language-specific adaptation
- VS Code task templates require careful parameterization
- CI matrix builds need robust language detection

**High Risk:**
- Feature matrix system highly Flutter-specific, becomes example only
- Some Python scripts have deep Flutter assumptions that must be abstracted
- Advanced monitoring may not translate directly to all languages
