# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This automation template is designed to be framework-agnostic and receives security updates as follows:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this automation template seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)

If you prefer to encrypt your email, you can use our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[Your PGP public key block would go here]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your email within **48 hours**, and will send a more detailed response within **5 business days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will:

1. **Investigate** the issue and work on reproducing it
2. **Determine the impact** and assign a severity level
3. **Develop a fix** if needed
4. **Test the fix** thoroughly
5. **Release the fix** as soon as practical
6. **Publicly disclose** the vulnerability details after users have had time to update

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
4. Release new versions as quickly as possible

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system beyond what is necessary to demonstrate a vulnerability
- Report vulnerabilities as soon as practical after discovery
- Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond the minimal testing required

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who follow these guidelines.

## Security Features

This automation template includes several security features:

### Secrets Detection
- **Gitleaks** integration for detecting secrets in code
- Pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
- CI/CD pipelines that scan for exposed credentials

### Dependency Scanning
- Language-specific vulnerability scanners:
  - Python: `safety` and `pip-audit`
  - Node.js: `npm audit`
  - Java: OWASP Dependency Check
  - Go: `govulncheck`
  - Rust: `cargo audit`
  - .NET: Built-in vulnerability scanning

### Code Quality
- Linting rules that catch security-related issues
- Static analysis tools integration
- Secure coding standards enforcement

### CI/CD Security
- Minimal permissions for GitHub Actions
- Pinned action versions with SHA hashes
- Secure artifact handling
- Environment isolation

## Security Best Practices

When using this automation template:

### For Template Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update all dependencies and tools
2. **Review Generated Configurations**: Audit all generated configuration files
3. **Use Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
4. **Enable Security Scanning**: Use all available security scanning tools
5. **Regular Security Reviews**: Conduct regular security assessments

### For CI/CD

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions to CI/CD systems
2. **Artifact Security**: Secure build artifacts and deployment pipelines
3. **Environment Separation**: Keep development, staging, and production separate
4. **Audit Logs**: Enable and monitor audit logs for all systems

### For Development

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
3. **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Logging**: Log security events but not sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Template-Specific Risks

1. **Script Execution**: The bootstrap scripts download and execute code
   - **Mitigation**: Use official repositories and verify checksums
   - **User Action**: Review scripts before execution

2. **Dependency Installation**: Automatic dependency installation
   - **Mitigation**: Use lock files and verified sources
   - **User Action**: Regular security updates

3. **Configuration Generation**: Dynamic configuration file creation
   - **Mitigation**: Use secure defaults and validation
   - **User Action**: Review generated configurations

### Language-Specific Risks

- **Python**: pip packages from PyPI may contain malicious code
- **Node.js**: npm packages have frequent security issues
- **Java**: Maven Central occasionally has compromised packages
- **Go**: Module proxy vulnerabilities
- **Rust**: Crates.io dependency confusion attacks

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Use Official Sources**: Only use official package repositories
2. **Verify Signatures**: Check package signatures when available
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated vulnerability scanning
5. **Code Review**: Review all dependencies and template modifications
