# ü§ñ Enhanced Feature Implementation Automation

This guide explains how to use the enhanced automation system that can automatically detect implemented features and suggest the next ones to work on.

## üîç Feature Detection System

The automation system can now:

1. **Detect Implementation Status**: Analyze folder structure to determine if features are not started, scaffolded, in progress, or complete
2. **Suggest Next Feature**: Automatically recommend the next feature to implement based on priority and epic grouping
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify mismatches between `feature_matrix.yaml` status and actual implementation
4. **Auto-Implementation**: Run implementation workflows without manual feature selection

## üöÄ Available Workflows

### 1. Auto-Implement Feature (Enhanced)

**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-implement-feature.yml`

**Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch

**New Features**:
- **Auto-detection**: Leave `feature_id` empty to automatically detect the next feature
- **Status analysis**: Optional implementation status analysis before proceeding
- **Enhanced PR descriptions**: Shows current status and suggests next feature
- **Smarter validation**: Checks for both full feature ID and short name directories

**Usage**:
```bash
# Auto-detect next feature
gh workflow run auto-implement-feature.yml

# Implement specific feature (original behavior)
gh workflow run auto-implement-feature.yml \
  --field feature_id="ui.app_shell"

# Show analysis before implementing
gh workflow run auto-implement-feature.yml \
  --field analyze_first=true
```

### 2. Auto-Implement Next Feature (New)

**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-implement-next-feature.yml`

**Features**:
- Analyzes current implementation state
- Triggers implementation of the next priority feature
- Generates comprehensive implementation reports
- Optional continuous mode for batch implementation

**Usage**:
```bash
# Implement next single feature
gh workflow run auto-implement-next-feature.yml

# Continuous implementation mode (up to 3 P0/P1 features)
gh workflow run auto-implement-next-feature.yml \
  --field continuous_mode=true \
  --field max_features=3
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Detection Script Usage

### Command Line Tool

**File**: `scripts/detect_feature_status.py`

**Basic Commands**:
```bash
# Get next suggested feature
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --suggest-next

# Analyze all features
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --analyze-all

# Check specific feature status
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --feature-id ui.app_shell

# Find implementation gaps
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --check-gaps

# Check for dependency-blocked features
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --check-blocked

# JSON output for automation
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --suggest-next --json
```

### Status Detection Logic

The system determines implementation status by checking:

1. **Directory Exists**: `lib/features/{feature_name}/`
2. **Domain Layer**: `lib/features/{feature_name}/domain/` with .dart files
3. **Data Layer**: `lib/features/{feature_name}/data/` with .dart files  
4. **Presentation Layer**: `lib/features/{feature_name}/presentation/` with .dart files
5. **Tests**: `test/features/{feature_name}/` with .dart files

**Status Mapping**:
- **Not Started**: 0% completeness (no directory)
- **Scaffolded**: < 50% completeness (directory + some files)
- **In Progress**: 50-99% completeness (most layers present)
- **Complete**: 100% completeness (all layers + tests)

### Feature Priority Logic

Next features are suggested based on:

1. **Dependencies**: Only features with satisfied dependencies are considered
2. **Priority**: P0 > P1 > P2 > P3
3. **Epic Grouping**: Features from same epic grouped together
4. **Matrix Status**: Only `planned` features are suggested
5. **Implementation Status**: Prefers `not_started` over `scaffolded`

## üìä Integration with Existing Workflows

### GitHub Actions Integration

The detection system integrates with existing workflows:

```yaml
# In your workflow
- name: Get next feature
  id: detect
  run: |
    python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --suggest-next --workflow-output >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- name: Use detected feature
  run: |
    echo "Next feature: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.next_feature_id }}"
    echo "Priority: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.next_feature_priority }}"
```

### VS Code Integration

You can run detection directly in VS Code:

1. Open terminal: `Ctrl+Shift+`` `
2. Run detection: `python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --suggest-next`
3. Implement suggested feature: `python scripts/auto_implement_feature.py {feature_id}`

## üîÑ Recommended Development Workflow

### Option 1: Fully Automated
```bash
# Start automated implementation cycle
gh workflow run auto-implement-next-feature.yml --field continuous_mode=true

# System will:
# 1. Detect next P0/P1 feature
# 2. Generate scaffold + PR
# 3. Continue with next feature
# 4. Stop when no more P0/P1 features
```

### Option 2: Semi-Automated
```bash
# 1. Check what's next
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --suggest-next

# 2. Implement it
gh workflow run auto-implement-feature.yml

# 3. Use GitHub Copilot to complete implementation
# 4. Merge PR
# 5. Repeat from step 1
```

### Option 3: Manual with Detection
```bash
# 1. Analyze current state
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --analyze-all

# 2. Check for gaps
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --check-gaps

# 3. Pick specific feature
gh workflow run auto-implement-feature.yml --field feature_id="specific.feature"
```

## üìà Monitoring & Reports

### Implementation Reports

The system generates comprehensive reports showing:
- Current implementation status by epic
- Priority distribution
- Gap analysis (matrix vs implementation)
- Next 5 suggested features
- Implementation velocity metrics

### Artifacts

Each workflow run creates artifacts:
- `implementation-report-{run_id}`: Detailed status report
- `automation-monitoring-{run_id}`: Execution logs and metrics

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Priority Logic

To modify feature suggestion logic, edit `scripts/detect_feature_status.py`:

```python
def suggest_next_feature(self):
    # Custom sorting logic here
    candidates.sort(key=lambda x: (
        priority_order.get(x["priority"], 4),  # Priority first
        x["epic"],  # Then by epic
        x["feature_id"]  # Finally by ID
    ))
```

### Feature Status Overrides

You can manually override detection by updating `feature_matrix.yaml`:

```yaml
features:
  - id: my.feature
    status: done  # Forces system to treat as complete
    # ... rest of feature definition
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No features suggested**: All P0/P1 features implemented
   - Solution: Check P2/P3 features or update matrix status

2. **Wrong feature detected**: Directory structure doesn't match naming
   - Solution: Ensure feature directory matches `{epic}.{feature}` pattern

3. **Gap analysis shows mismatches**: Matrix status ‚â† implementation status
   - Solution: Update `feature_matrix.yaml` or complete implementation

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check specific feature detection
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --feature-id problem.feature

# Full analysis with JSON for debugging
python scripts/detect_feature_status.py --analyze-all --json > debug.json

# Check automation system health
python scripts/automation_monitor.py check
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Try auto-detection**: Run a workflow without specifying feature_id
2. **Review generated reports**: Check artifacts for implementation status
3. **Set up continuous integration**: Use the continuous mode for batch implementation
4. **Customize for your needs**: Modify detection logic or priority rules

The enhanced automation system makes feature development more efficient by removing the manual overhead of tracking what's implemented and what should be done next.
