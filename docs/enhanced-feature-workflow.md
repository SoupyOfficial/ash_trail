## Commands

### `start-next-feature`

Enhanced feature initialization with comprehensive validation and AI guidance.

```bash
# Basic usage - suggests next feature automatically
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --json

# Specify explicit feature
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --feature-id ui.loading_skeletons --json

# Dry run to preview actions
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --dry-run --json

# Auto-commit scaffold and push to remote
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --auto-commit --push --json

# Custom ordering mode
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --order-mode priority --json
```

**Options:**
- `--feature-id`: Explicit feature to start (overrides suggestion)
- `--order-mode`: Feature selection order (`matrix`|`priority`|`appearance`)
- `--dry-run`: Preview actions without making changes
- `--auto-commit`: Automatically commit scaffold and prompt files
- `--push`: Push new feature branch to remote (implies --auto-commit)

### `rollback-feature`

Safely rollback a feature start operation to restore previous state.

```bash
# Rollback specific feature
python scripts/dev_assistant.py rollback-feature --feature-id ui.loading_skeletons --json
```

**What gets rolled back:**
- Uncommitted changes reset
- Original branch restored
- Feature branch deleted (if created)
- Created files/directories removed
- Feature matrix status reverted

### `finalize-feature`

Enhanced feature finalization with comprehensive validation.

```bash
# Dry run validation (recommended first)
python scripts/dev_assistant.py finalize-feature --feature-id ui.loading_skeletons --dry-run --json

# Finalize feature (commits all changes)
python scripts/dev_assistant.py finalize-feature --feature-id ui.loading_skeletons --json

# Finalize and push
python scripts/dev_assistant.py finalize-feature --feature-id ui.loading_skeletons --push --json
```

### `workflow-telemetry`

Analyze workflow performance and success metrics.

```bash
# Analyze last 7 days (default)
python scripts/dev_assistant.py workflow-telemetry --json

# Analyze last 30 days
python scripts/dev_assistant.py workflow-telemetry --days 30 --json
```

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Feature Selection & Validation

1. **Intelligent Selection**: System suggests next feature based on priorities, dependencies, and complexity
2. **Pre-flight Checks**: Comprehensive validation of workspace state, dependencies, and readiness
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential conflicts, missing dependencies, or blocking issues

### Phase 2: Workspace Preparation

1. **Rollback Point**: Creates automatic rollback point for safe recovery
2. **Branch Creation**: Creates feature branch with consistent naming (`feat/feature_name`)
3. **Scaffolding**: Generates Clean Architecture folder structure (`domain/`, `data/`, `presentation/`)
4. **Feature Matrix Update**: Updates status from `planned` to `in_progress`

### Phase 3: AI Context Generation

1. **Context Analysis**: Analyzes related features, existing patterns, and implementation hints
2. **Complexity Assessment**: Estimates feature complexity and development time
3. **Enhanced Prompt**: Generates comprehensive AI implementation guide with:
   - Structured requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Architectural patterns and constraints
   - Step-by-step implementation strategy
   - Quality gates and validation checklists
   - Anti-patterns and common pitfalls

### Phase 4: Development Loop

1. **Implementation**: Follow AI prompt guidance with TDD approach
2. **Validation**: Continuous testing and coverage monitoring
3. **Quality Gates**: Automated checks for architecture compliance

### Phase 5: Feature Completion

1. **Pre-finalization**: Dry-run validation ensures all criteria met
2. **Final Validation**: Tests pass, coverage maintained, todos completed
3. **Atomic Commit**: Single commit with all feature changes
4. **Status Update**: Feature matrix updated to `done`

## Pre-flight Validation Checks

The system performs comprehensive validation before starting any feature work:

### Critical Checks (Block Execution)
- **Dependencies**: All required features completed
- **System Tools**: Flutter, Git available and functional
- **Feature Conflicts**: No existing implementation or conflicting work

### Warning Checks (Allow with Warnings)
- **Git Status**: Uncommitted changes present
- **Branch Status**: Already on feature branch
- **Coverage**: Below minimum threshold
- **Feature Exists**: Partial implementation detected

## AI Prompt Structure

The enhanced AI prompts follow a structured format optimized for agentic AI comprehension:

### 1. Mission & Context
- Clear feature objective and scope
- Epic and priority classification
- Complexity and time estimates

### 2. Requirements Analysis
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications
- Performance and accessibility requirements

### 3. Architecture Guidance
- Clean Architecture boundaries
- Technology stack and patterns
- Related features and reference implementations

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- Phase-based development approach
- TDD methodology
- Quality gates and validation

### 5. Delivery Checklist
- Code structure requirements
- Testing standards
- Documentation expectations

## Safety Mechanisms

### Rollback Points
Automatic rollback points enable safe recovery from failed operations:
- Git state preservation
- File system snapshots
- Configuration backups

### Atomic Operations
All workflow steps are designed to be atomic:
- Either complete successfully or fail cleanly
- No partial state corruption
- Automatic cleanup on failure

### Error Recovery
Comprehensive error handling and recovery:
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Clear error messages with suggested fixes
- Automatic retry for transient failures

## Telemetry and Monitoring

### Metrics Collected
- Workflow execution times
- Success/failure rates
- Pre-flight check results
- Feature complexity vs actual development time
- Common failure patterns

### Analysis Features
- Success rate trends
- Performance bottlenecks identification
- Failure pattern analysis
- Workflow optimization recommendations

## Best Practices for Agentic AI

### 1. Always Use Dry Run First
```bash
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --dry-run --json
```

### 2. Review Pre-flight Checks
- Address critical errors before proceeding
- Consider warnings and their impact
- Ensure dependencies are truly satisfied

### 3. Follow the Generated AI Prompt
- Read the entire prompt before starting implementation
- Follow the phase-based approach
- Use the provided checklists

### 4. Validate Frequently
```bash
python scripts/dev_assistant.py finalize-feature --dry-run --json
```

### 5. Monitor Telemetry
```bash
python scripts/dev_assistant.py workflow-telemetry --json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pre-flight checks failing:**
- Review specific check failures in the output
- Follow provided fix suggestions
- Run `git status` to understand workspace state

**Feature suggestion returns null:**
- Check that dependencies are completed
- Verify feature matrix has planned features
- Consider using explicit `--feature-id`

**Rollback fails:**
- Manual cleanup may be required
- Check rollback file in `.dev_assistant_rollback/`
- Restore git state manually if needed

**AI prompt generation errors:**
- Verify feature exists in feature matrix
- Check YAML syntax in feature_matrix.yaml
- Ensure all required fields are present

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, use the existing logging infrastructure:

```bash
python scripts/dev_assistant.py start-next-feature --log-file debug.log --json
```

## Migration from Previous Workflow

The enhanced workflow is backward compatible with the previous implementation. Existing scripts and automation will continue to work, with additional features available through new command-line options.
