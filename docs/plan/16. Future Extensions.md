## 16. Future Extensions

> This section documents **explicitly non-implemented** but planned or plausible extensions.  
> Nothing in this section should be assumed to exist in the current codebase.

### 16.1 Advanced Analytics

#### 16.1.1 Predictive Models

##### Overview

Potential future capability to analyze historical log data and generate forward-looking insights (e.g., usage trends, risk indicators).

##### Responsibilities
- Consume historical log entries across one or more accounts
- Generate derived metrics or predictions
- Surface results in a read-only, advisory capacity

##### Data Structures

_Not implemented._

Expected inputs:
- LogEntry (existing domain model)
- Aggregated time windows (daily / rolling)

Expected outputs:
- PredictionResult (derived, ephemeral)
  - `metricName: string`
  - `timeHorizon: Duration`
  - `predictedValue: num`
  - `confidence?: num`

##### State & Flow

- Read-only access to persisted logs
- Computation performed on-demand or via background job
- Results are **never** written back as authoritative log data

##### Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- Sparse or inconsistent historical data
- Multi-account contamination if scoping is incorrect
- Overfitting or misleading outputs

##### Assumptions

- Predictions are advisory, not prescriptive
- No medical or health claims are made

##### Open Questions

- Should models run locally only, or allow opt-in external compute?
- Are predictions per-account or cross-account?
- How are confidence levels communicated to users?

### 16.2 External Integrations

#### 16.2.1 Wearables

##### Overview

Potential integration with third-party wearable devices to enrich logs with contextual or passive data.

##### Responsibilities
- Authenticate with external providers
- Ingest time-series data
- Correlate external signals with internal logs

##### Data Structures

_Not implemented._

Expected external inputs:
- Timestamped sensor records (format provider-specific)

Expected internal mapping:
- ExternalRecord → DerivedContext (non-authoritative)

##### State & Flow

- External sync occurs independently of manual logging
- Imported data is **annotative**, not a source of truth
- No automatic log creation without explicit user action

##### Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- Clock drift between devices
- Partial syncs or missing intervals
- API rate limits or provider outages

##### Assumptions

- All integrations are optional and revocable
- No background sync without user consent

##### Open Questions

- Which providers are in scope (Apple Health, Google Fit, etc.)?
- Is data stored raw or normalized?
- How is external data visually distinguished?

---

### 16.3 Data Export

#### 16.3.1 CSV

##### Overview

Allow users to export structured log data for external analysis.

##### Responsibilities
- Serialize logs into flat, tabular format
- Preserve ordering and timestamps
- Respect active account boundaries

##### Data Structures

Export schema (example):
- `timestamp`
- `accountId`
- `duration`
- `notes?`
- `tags?`

##### State & Flow

- Triggered manually by user
- Export generated from local database
- No mutation of underlying data

##### Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- Large exports impacting memory
- Locale-specific formatting (dates, decimals)
- CSV injection risks

##### Open Questions

- Should exports be scoped by date range?
- Should tags be flattened or expanded?

---

#### 16.3.2 JSON

##### Overview

Machine-readable export intended for re-import or automation.

##### Responsibilities
- Emit structured, lossless representations
- Maintain schema versioning

##### Data Structures

- `ExportBundle`
  - `schemaVersion: string`
  - `exportedAt: DateTime`
  - `accounts: Account[]`
  - `logs: LogEntry[]`

##### State & Flow

- User-initiated
- Stateless generation
- Output is immutable

##### Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- Schema drift across app versions
- Partial exports if interrupted

##### Open Questions

- Should imports from JSON be supported later?
- How strict should schema validation be?

---

### 16.4 Automation

#### 16.4.1 Scheduled Summaries

##### Overview

Automatically generate periodic summaries of logging activity.

##### Responsibilities
- Aggregate logs over a defined window
- Produce human-readable summaries
- Deliver summaries without requiring app interaction

##### Data Structures

_Not implemented._

Expected derived artifacts:
- SummaryReport
  - `periodStart`
  - `periodEnd`
  - `metrics`
  - `notes`

##### State & Flow

- Background scheduler triggers aggregation
- Summaries are derived, not stored as logs
- Delivery via in-app view or notification

##### Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- App suspended or background execution restricted
- Missed schedules due to OS constraints
- Timezone changes mid-period

##### Assumptions

- Automation respects OS battery and background limits
- Users can disable or modify schedules

##### Open Questions

- Daily vs weekly vs rolling summaries?
- Are summaries persisted or ephemeral?
- Should summaries be per-account or global?

---

### Summary Constraints

- All future extensions are **opt-in**
- No extension may mutate historical log data
- Core logging remains authoritative
- Extensions must degrade gracefully when unavailable
