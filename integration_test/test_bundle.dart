  // This is the entrypoint of the bundled Dart test.
  //
  // Its responsibilities are:
  //  * Running a special Dart test that runs before all the other tests and
  //    explores the hierarchy of groups and tests.
  //  * Hosting a PatrolAppService, which the native side of Patrol uses to get
  //    the Dart tests, and to request execution of a specific Dart test.
  //
  // When running on Android, the Android Test Orchestrator, before running the
  // tests, makes an initial run to gather the tests that it will later run. The
  // native side of Patrol (specifically: PatrolJUnitRunner class) is hooked
  // into the Android Test Orchestrator lifecycle and knows when that initial
  // run happens. When it does, PatrolJUnitRunner makes an RPC call to
  // PatrolAppService and asks it for Dart tests.
  //
  // When running on iOS, the native side of Patrol (specifically: the
  // PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER macro) makes an initial run to gather
  // the tests that it will later run (same as the Android). During that initial
  // run, it makes an RPC call to PatrolAppService and asks it for Dart tests.
  //
  // Once the native runner has the list of Dart tests, it dynamically creates
  // native test cases from them. On Android, this is done using the
  // Parametrized JUnit runner. On iOS, new test case methods are swizzled into
  // the RunnerUITests class, taking advantage of the very dynamic nature of
  // Objective-C runtime.
  //
  // Execution of these dynamically created native test cases is then fully
  // managed by the underlying native test framework (JUnit on Android, XCTest
  // on iOS). The native test cases do only one thing - request execution of the
  // Dart test (out of which they had been created) and wait for it to complete.
  // The result of running the Dart test is the result of the native test case.
